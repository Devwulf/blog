Rip brain, that was trippy! Superliminal is a really cool idea of a game and it wasn't that hard either, but towards the end, my head started hurting with all the lights and colors! Maybe I should get tested for epilepsy...

Anyways, that also gave me an idea for my game! My goal with my game is to show that with magic, anything should be possible. Now, after playing that game, I've realized that I've been too small-minded with my spells. I agree that there should be some normal spells, but there should also be some crazy, fun spells too! Maybe even something to do with perspectives, like in that game. Or even general relativity. Who knows, the sky's the limit!

I've also been thinking about "awakening" or "breaking through" in my game. Basically, spells grow in power the more you use them, up to a certain limit. However, you can increase that ceiling/limit by "breaking through" to the next level. I may change how exactly these mechanics would work in the future.

Right now, I can't think straight. I'd probably just blabber on about useless stuff and I don't wanna ruin these mechanics just because I tried forcing some ideas in even though they won't fit at all.

I definitely need sleep right now...
